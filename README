This project is an exclusive collaboration between Kanu Shetkar, Zachary Shaffer, and Joshua Millman

The purpose of this project is to create a plagiarism checker for computer science
assignments of all multiple file formats.

Elements needed for project
- PDF Reader extract text
- process text
    - tokenize
    - compare sets of data - evaluate replication
- training data
    - use training dataset
    - cite sources https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/16/info
- create labelled dataframe for each case
    - one column is TFIDF Value
        - possibly do multiple vectors
        - think movie recommender
    - other is if plagiarized or not
    - comparison is made to original source code file(s)
        - possibly cosine distance from original file vector to

- create one class for data being evaluated
    - store data to be compared to original class into dataframe
    - tokenize both dataframes by words
    - compare dataframes to extract similarity

- need to filter out files from the original folder in our train data and
get those vectors but we dont want to put in in the training data set
- put it between original and each row of the cosine distance and measure that
